    Bit tough to hear yourself think above the thumping machienery. However, in front
    of you is the emergency exit door, It has oversized, cast iron lock hanging from
    a bolted handle. You could try picking the lock, or maybe look for a way to pry
    it off.


    What to do?


    1. Pick it.

    2. Pry it.'
