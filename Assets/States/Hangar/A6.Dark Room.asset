  storyText: 'Right, well, that took far longer than anticipated but the lock is off
    and the door opened. Thank goodness for the Pumping Station being so loud.


    You''re in a dark room, You hear people yelling over the top of the combustion
    boilers. You catch some words. THUNK, THUNK, "shut off the valves...", THUNK,
    THUNK, "...get out in time?", THUNK, THUNK, "...massive pressure", THUNK, THUNK
    "...for glory", THUNK...


    What next, Adventurer?

    1. Get closer to the people speaking.

    2. Ignore them, keep pushing for the airship.
