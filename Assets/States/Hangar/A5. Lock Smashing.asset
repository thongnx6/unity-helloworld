  storyText: 'Got to be something around here to help with some smashy smashy. You
    see a crate with all manner of pipes, writes and cogs cattered within it. Mostly
    trash.


    You could try the brute force approach - wack the lock with one of the pipes.
    Or you could take some time to build a contraption with some kind of laverage,
    maybe a mini pulley system with those wries and the cogs.


    How to proceed?

    1. No time to waste, grab the pipe, start wacking.

    2. Take the time to build a leverage-gadget.'
